<p>(I must maintain, absolutely, anonymity here:)<br>
Isn’t it sad people can’t send confidential emails to one another. </p>  

<p>Although, totally done in disrespect (as confidential letters), emails are forwarded around workplaces like nothing else.<br>
(So here is not one email.)</p><br>

<p>I would never say anything - but casual- in an email: I didn’t want anyone else to read— to the contrary: the more people read my emails the more effective they are…  And lets be frank:  our office does not work effectively.  In fact I believe this dragging of corpses around the office is looked on with institutional approval:  Fixing problems in efficiencies means no longer goosing the bottom line.  Managers have little or no incentive for fighting to create effective systems because this impedes the masses of redundancies from sitting around all day disturbing those of us who are pulling our own weight, and then some.</p><br>

<p>We have huge problems to address with our industry yet are compelled nearly to address needless things, never gaining efficiencies, never meeting standards and goals we set (as a person or company) but most importantly, never gaining a cutting edge.  And like I said this is all but too intentional. (Sure if your a ‘do nothing’ kind of person this is great; but I am not, I have exhausted myself and am burdened only more by this not less.)</p>

<p>In my eyes, the company is changing and I am powerless, (weather for the better or not) the reasoning is never clarified, never followed through on, never distributed— to the effect of a stalemate.</p><br>

<p>The company broke its promises to me; the trust between it an myself are broken, and I am forced to leave the company just to meed my own basic needs which are monetary but also so more personal, i.e., growth and trust, furthering my own work and wellbeing.  I have learned so much here at [our company]: I learned about agencies and business, and of course furthered development in my specialty.  Our team, is like a family, and although our relationships are merely professional, wth rare exceptions, it became all that I had, as work consumed more and more of me and my effect, and feelings, became less and less. </p><br>
<p>That is, my feeling for the well being of the company have been reduced to nothing, while my sympathy for my co-workers, peers across many departments, has grown to horrible proportions.  I worry about them.  We have a 4 tier company  (simple: Use those at the bottom until there is nothing left of them and they are gone) (As this is a familiar theme for workers, I must be compelled to ask: isn’t [our company] above this struggle that plagues nearly all working industries, that is, consistent deliberate diminution of the worker?  I believed for a year or more we were above this, I see means within ourself to live and enact fair and proper policies still.</p><br>

<p>
<strong>1)</strong> The no-bodies, freelancers/ ‘consultants’ and sub-contracted employees -(paid by wholly other entities which we pay—> like receptionist, service staff (nearly 2 months without pay I went)<br>
<strong>2)</strong> Low level employees —> who are used to a disrespectful disgusting degree- (as I was) lied to - cheated, pressured, bullied, acted against illegally <br>
<strong>3)</strong> Managers and senior staff (i.e. directors, group supervisors, associate directors, and vice presidents)<br>
<strong>4)</strong> Stake holders (executive vice presidents and above) 
</p><br><br>
<p>
<strong>1)</strong> <br>
I learned immediately, my first week, speaking to the reception person, of course, our service staff are contracted out, irresponsibly or horribly, not actually employees entitled to any benefits the company offers.  Imagine what that does to a person, I have, and worked like that for many years. I know how awful and humiliating it can be. (Case in point is the young man Ross (reception), he left the company he worked for many months ago-  and good for him!)  Ross wanted to be an employee of [our company], he is a designer with an art degree. One day I even noticed members of our company sitting with him, apparently reviewing his portfolio, and after diligent work at [our company] for perhaps a year, struggling, greeting us every day; we him no offer.  
How embarrassing for him.  And, how embarrassing for the company… (we do not keep promises to people, we do not see potential in people, but we will absolutely use anyone, anyone, to save a dollar…anyone)</p><br>

<p>
I came up with a new motto /slogan the other day for the company (not be ‘brave’ ‘never finished’ or bold beginnings, but:)  “We brake rules”
What a joke - ‘Bold Beginnings’, give me a break- never more an empowering nod to the exact disfunction as this.  Not ‘give two shits’: but: ‘don’t trust us, well brake all the rules’  we are not the well the balk—> we are horrible horrible masters, above the law, uncontrollable, and certainly not in control ourselves, after all we can always blame, (anyone else) the conglomerate, and the corporation whose vast will shadows our own in every way, apparently overshadows our own policies, some which don’t even exist, or conform to some state, interstate, or city regulations, which we do not need to follow.  Don’t trust us, you should know that by now.  And if you don’t know, just try, we will come down on you so hard in every direction:  HR will be all over you.  And everything we will use to our advantage, your disadvantage, by whatever means, proxy, lie… It doesn’t matter at all, as the control is maintained.</p><br> 

<p>
The company does break the law, it doesn’t comply with labor standards (paying for instance, non - exempt empt IT employees overtime)  doesn’t comply with payroll standards regarding tracking hours, yet we will pinch any person for less then 8 hours on any day (m-f) practices incoherent with our own policies many times over.</p><br>    

<p>
Not conforming to the law is a serious matter, but also, not realizing the importance of consistent policies is serious as well.  Our company fails to execute coherent policies, (that is internally coherent, consilient with our corporate policies, and that which are in accordance with the law). </p><br>

<p>
Break your promises to me, act illegally towards me, obfuscate, diminish me, fine… (that is between you an me)</p><br>

<p>
But to use people so systemically: this must stop.  It is illegal, against our own principles, and not in the better interest of our work and clients.  We can do more for our clients by being pro active on these items but we are far beyond that now,we are far far beyond that. I for-see great pain for the company.</p><br>

<p>
Now I will return to reasoning I used in a previous argument (an argument about [our company] but not originating here, but as within the larger context): </p><br>
<p>
… The good jobs/accounts, the jobs with the most money, should be the least work, for they should be the better organized and resourced. <br>
If this is not the case then we are working against ourselves rather than working with the good will of the client.</p><br>

<p>
When the client is under the weather (fallen on tough times), so to speak, this is then -when we must work under such conditions.</p><br>

<p>
The accounts with the most money should be the good accounts, the valuable accounts, not the most difficult. Unless that is we have set a dangerous precedent. (Allowing members of our company to inflate themselves to detriment to us- their co-workers and not to the benefit of the client, is dangerous to everyone involved. (And just to reiterate, when the client is happy, with returns, relations are good. Thus, accounts in good standing are not acting on behalf of the company or client when they make our lives difficult up or down)</p><br>

<p>
This is where the quality of the work and the value of it come into struggle and I am suggesting we have it on its head. The best brands should have the best products because, only then, the machine is working efficiently.</p><br>

<p>
But if by a general rule of thumb, we allow, the inverse to be true, as it is today, we attentively give too much, demoting relations with our clients —> at the general neglect of the easier work, where there are ‘less eyes looking’, which is, truly of highest potential, our place to shine as an agency.</p><br>
